\title{Create an object of class PP, a low rank Predictive Process used as a prior to describe 
spatial variations of covariance parameters}
\usage{
createPP(observed_locs, matern_range = NULL, knots = NULL, m = 10, seed = 1234)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed_locs}{a matrix of spatial coordinates where observations are done}

\item{matern_range}{either a positive number used to set the Matérn range of the PP or NULL, 
if NULL, a default PP range is guessed from the spatial locations.}

\item{knots}{either (i) a matrix of spatial knots used for the PP, 
(ii) or a positive integer used to set the number of knots, the knots being then found using kmeans, 
(iii) or NULL, a default number and placement of knots being guessed from the spatial locations.}

\item{m}{number of nearest neighbors to do Vecchia's approximation who goes into PP}

\item{seed}{integer used as a seed}
}
\value{
a list
}
