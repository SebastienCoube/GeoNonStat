\title{Comparison between PP and NNGP
Allows to see if a Predictive Process has enough knots.
Plots two samples, one from a Predictive Process, and one from the Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process the PP is obtained from.
If there are not enough knots, the PP should be over-smoothed with respect to the NNGP.}
\usage{
compare_PP_NNGP(PP, cex = 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{PP}{a Predictive Process object (produced by `createPP()`)}
}
\value{
a plot
